    <h2>Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.</h2>
    
    <dl style="color: white">
        <dt>&nbsp; Loss of Habitat</dt>
        <dd>A loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for example, lost their habitat 65 million years ago. <br>
        The climate that was once hot and dry very quickly became much colder. Dinosaurs could not adapt <br>
         quick enough and very quickly became endangered, then extinct </dd>
<br>
         <dd>Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for housing and industry reduce the native wildlife.</dd>
<br>
        <dd>Developers have cleared hundreds of thousands of acres of <i> The Amazon Rain Forest</i> for cattle ranches, logging, and urban use.</dd>


<br>
        <dt>&nbsp; Loss of Genetic Variation</dt>
        <dd>Genetic variation is the diversity foudn within a species. It's why human beings may have blond, red, brown, or black hair. Genetic variation allows species to adapt to changed in the environment.  Usually, the greater the population of a species, the greater its genetic variation.</dd>
<br>
        <dd>Groups of species that have a tendency to inbreed usually have little genetic variation, because no new genetic information is introduced to the group. This makes disease much more common and much more deadly, among the imbread groups.</dd>
<br>
        <dd>Loss of genetic variation can happen naturally. For example cheetahs are a threatened species native to Africa and Asia. Scientists believe durring the last ice age cheetahs went through a long period of inbreeding. Therefore there are very few genetic differences betweeen cheetahs and they cannot adapt to changes in their enviroment as quickly which leads to fewer cheetahs surviving to maturity.</dd>
